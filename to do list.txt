. fix glm bug (can't read same file twice, current use copy struct(in main) temporary fix it)
. modify to multiple plane split (how to judge face & back piece?(face judge done) each vertex judge plane,then intersection)
. fill model method
. free vector memory
. viewing cut plane in other viewer (output obj file)
. modify glmWriteOBJ (temporary fix it, but maybe use group to represent split piece in future)
. modify glmDelete
. modify collect_edge() (when done split, modify all_edge data)
